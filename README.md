I'm making a game in the Frontier:Elite 2 style, using only the Java standard libraries

This is an extension of some early 3d-projection I managed to do with Java's 2d canvas,I want to see how far I can take it. The systems for this game have been on my mind for a while, I now just need to get to it and write the damned thing.
